Broadly, CRS fall two categories: geodetic (geographic) projected. geodetic CRS models Earth 3D ellipsoid represents locations using angular coordinates — latitude longitude. systems ideal global positioning mapping preserving true geographic coordinates important. However, represent curved surfaces spherical model, suitable accurate distance area calculations flat maps. Common examples geodetic CRS include WGS 84 (EPSG:4326), used GPS global datasets, NAD83 (EPSG:4269), widely used North America.contrast, projected CRS transforms geographic coordinates onto 2D surface using mathematical projections. allows accurate measurements distance, area, direction localized regions. Projected systems distort properties (e.g., shape, area, scale) can tailored specific mapping needs. Examples projected CRS include UTM zones (e.g., UTM Zone 17N, EPSG:26917) State Plane systems like North Carolina State Plane (EPSG:32119), optimized regional accuracy commonly used government environmental datasets.Comparison geodetic projected CRS.Global coverage (e.g., GPS)Standard data exchange web mapsEasy interpret (lat/lon)distance, area, direction calculationsCurved surface ideal flat map operationsEnables accurate measurements (distance, area)Optimized regional analysisSupports specialized map projectionsDistorts geographic propertiesLimited specific regionsMust choose right projection purpose","code":""}]
