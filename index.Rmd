# Preface {.unnumbered}

## Introduction {.unnumbered}

Welcome to R-GIS for Ecology, which introduces R-based GIS applications for ecologists.

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have long been implemented using platforms like ArcGIS and QGIS.
However, R now offers powerful and flexible tools that allow ecologists to integrate GIS workflows directly into their data analysis pipelines.
With R, users can handle spatial data, perform analyses, and create publication-quality maps, all within a reproducible coding environment.

This book provides a practical introduction to core GIS techniques with an ecological focus, covering essential tools, concepts, and workflows using R.
